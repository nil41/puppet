Puppet is a good choice if stability and maturity are key factors for you. 

Price: Puppet comes in a free open source version or a paid commercial enterprise version 
       that runs $112 per node per year, with volume discounts.
===========================
Pros:

Well-established support community through Puppet Labs.
It has the most mature interface and runs on nearly every OS.
Simple installation and initial setup.
Most complete Web UI in this space. (puppet enterprise consol )
Strong reporting capabilities.


For more advanced tasks, you will need to use the CLI, which is Ruby-based (meaning you’ll have to understand Ruby).
Support for pure-Ruby versions (rather than those using Puppet’s customized DSL) is being scaled back.
